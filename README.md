Docker-enabled Vagrant boxes
============================


## Purpose

Some Linux distributions don't have a pre-installed [Docker](http://www.docker.com) engine. Public Vagrant boxes (e.g., those in [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/) and [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)) also lack quality support for Docker. So I build these Vagrant boxes to aid my Docker development.

I also install some handy tools for Docker.


## For the impatient

Use the following public box names (all available from [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) service):


- Ubuntu 14.04.x LTS ("Trusty") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker), basically [ubuntu-14.04.3-server-amd64](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) + Docker

  - [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + [Docker Registry 2.0](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry)

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + Kubernetes *(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)*


- Debian 8 ("Jessie") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker), basically [debian/jessie64](https://vagrantcloud.com/debian/boxes/jessie64) + Docker - Chef - Puppet


- CentOS 7 x64:

  - [`williamyeh/centos7-docker`](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/williamyeh/boxes/centos7-docker/), basically [chef/centos-7.1](https://vagrantcloud.com/chef/boxes/centos-7.1) + Docker

## Build these boxes yourself

Here are steps you can follow to build these boxes on your own.


### Packer version

**NOTE: for [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker) only.**


First, install the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) tool on your host machine.

Second, pull the [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) submodule:

```
# pull the Bento project
git submodule init

# copy Bento stuff to sub-directories
# since Packer doesn't push soft links to Atlas (defects!)...
./copy-bento.sh
```

Third, generate the Vagrant box file of your choice:


```
# change working directory to any specific OS;
# for example, "ubuntu-trusty"
cd ubuntu-trusty


# build `ubuntu-trusty64-docker`, VirtualBox version:
packer build -only=virtualbox-iso  \
       ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json


# build `ubuntu-trusty64-docker`, VirtualBox version,
# with pre-downloaded ISO file from `file:///Volumes/ISO/`:
packer build -only=virtualbox-iso  \
       -var 'mirror=file:///Volumes/ISO/'  \
       ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json
```

If successful, you'll get an 'XXX.box' file in the `builds` directory.


Last, push to [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) if you like, and Atlas will build and host both virtualbox and vmware_desktop versions for you:

```
packer push ubuntu-trusty64-docker.json
```


### Non-Packer version

First, install the [`vagrant-vbguest`](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin on your host machine to make sure that the proper version of the host's *VirtualBox Guest Additions* be injected onto the guest system:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```


Second, generate the Vagrant box file of your choice:


```
# change working directory to any specific OS;
# for example, "debian-jessie"
cd debian-jessie

# build it!
./build.sh

# if successful, you'll get an 'XXX.box' file
ls -al
```


Then, you can use the generated box file as follows:

```
# give it a local name (e.g., "my-jessie64")
vagrant box add  --name my-jessie64  XXX.box

# now you'll see the box installed locally
vagrant box list

```
