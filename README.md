Docker-enabled Vagrant boxes
============================


## Purpose

Some Linux distributions don't have a pre-installed [Docker](http://www.docker.com) engine. Public Vagrant boxes (e.g., those in [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/) and [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)) also lack quality support for Docker. So I build these Vagrant boxes to aid my Docker development.

I also install some handy tools for Docker.


## For the impatient

Use the following public box names (all available from [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/)):


- Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS ("Trusty") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker), basically [ubuntu/trusty64](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64) + Docker - Chef - Puppet

  - [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + [Docker Registry](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry)

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + Kubernetes

  - [`3scale/docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/3scale/docker), a nice alternative.

- Debian jessie x64: [`williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker)

- CentOS 6.5 x64:

  - (TODO) williamyeh/centos65-docker

  - [`jdiprizio/centos-docker-io`](https://vagrantcloud.com/jdiprizio/centos-docker-io), a nice alternative.

- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) (only provided in [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes) box)


## Build these boxes yourself

Currently, Atlas (was: Vagrant Cloud) doesn't have an *automated build*  mechanism as in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) ecosystem. You might not trust those boxes I've put into Atlas; you might want more up-to-date packages in the box before I've update them.

OK, you can build these boxes as follows.

First, generate a Vagrant box file:


```
# change working directory to any specific OS;
# for example, "debian-jessie"
cd debian-jessie

# build it!
./build.sh

# if successful, you'll get an 'output.box' file
ls -al
```


Then, you can use the generated box file as follows:

```
# give it a local name (e.g., "my-jessie64")
vagrant box add  --name my-jessie64  output.box

# now you'll see the box installed locally
vagrant box list

```
