Docker-enabled Vagrant boxes
============================


## Purpose

Some Linux distributions don't have a pre-installed [Docker](http://www.docker.com) engine. Public Vagrant boxes (e.g., those in [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/) and [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/)) also lack quality support for Docker. So I build these Vagrant boxes to aid my Docker development.

I also install some handy tools for Docker.


## For the impatient

Use the following public box names (all available from [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) service):


- Ubuntu 14.04.x LTS ("Trusty") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker), basically [ubuntu/trusty64](https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64) + Docker - Chef - Puppet

  - [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + [Docker Registry 2.0](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry)

  - [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes), basically `williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-docker` + Kubernetes *(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)*


- Debian 8 ("Jessie") x64:

  - [`williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/debian-jessie64-docker), basically [debian/jessie64](https://vagrantcloud.com/debian/boxes/jessie64) + Docker - Chef - Puppet


- CentOS 7 x64:

  - [`williamyeh/centos7-docker`](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/williamyeh/boxes/centos7-docker/), basically [chef/centos-7.1](https://vagrantcloud.com/chef/boxes/centos-7.1) + Docker

- [Docker Registry 2.0](https://github.com/docker/docker-registry) (only provided in [`williamyeh/insecure-registry`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/insecure-registry) box)

- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes) (only provided in [`williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes`](https://vagrantcloud.com/williamyeh/ubuntu-trusty64-kubernetes) box) *(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)*


## Build these boxes yourself

Currently, HashiCorp (the company that invented and maintains the Vagrant tool) supports *automated build* mechanism for Vagrant boxes only through its [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) tool on its [Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) platform.

I do not use the [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) tool myself. The boxes generated by this project are uploaded to GitHub, and metadata submitted to Atlas *manually*.

You might not trust those pre-built boxes I've uploaded into Atlas; you might want more up-to-date packages in the box before I have time updating and uploading.

Here are steps you can follow.

First, install the [`vagrant-vbguest`](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin on your host machine to make sure that the proper version of the host's *VirtualBox Guest Additions* be injected onto the guest system:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```


Second, generate the Vagrant box file of your choice:


```
# change working directory to any specific OS;
# for example, "debian-jessie"
cd debian-jessie

# build it!
./build.sh

# if successful, you'll get an 'XXX.box' file
ls -al
```


Then, you can use the generated box file as follows:

```
# give it a local name (e.g., "my-jessie64")
vagrant box add  --name my-jessie64  XXX.box

# now you'll see the box installed locally
vagrant box list

```
